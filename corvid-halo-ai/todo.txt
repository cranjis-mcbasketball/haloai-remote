colums are mixed and they won't get the same experience when they come over repeatedly.

format so that instead of a straight line it's a grid

we currently have one word from each column, but we would want the first and last name.
a grid of 16 words -- one from each column other than the sentences (this placement makes it so people will subconsciously form sentences from the world)



then another column would be a sentence (colloquialisms or saying), and render under the grid
    - work towards forming actual sentences with machine learning algorithms. 
    - first step for this would be tracking number of "select now" clicks in the 
        form of dates. If I can implement that, machine learning algorithms will be able 
        to distinguish differences in complex data. They will run a binary classification problem 
        (a type of machine learning approach where you have two things you are trying to distinguish, 
        you'd run the dates and the binary classification problem would find patterns in the RNG data. 
        and then run a complex neural network. Can the machine distinguish the RNG data during the time 
        when people are interacting with the site vs when they are not. (ie: the machine learning
        algorithm will figure out that when there are observations, the data forms a curve of sin(3x), 
        and then the machine looks for those trends)
